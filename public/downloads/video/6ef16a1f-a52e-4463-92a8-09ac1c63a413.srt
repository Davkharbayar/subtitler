00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,325
Thank you for such a wonderful introduction.

2
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:08,445
Great.

3
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:10,985
I'm here today to talk about motivation.

4
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:16,745
And I've learned in my few years on this earth that motivation is really the key to affecting change.

5
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:26,921
In anything that you do, you can put a paper that was written without any motivation, without any effort, and you can put a paper that was written with drive and passion next to each other and it's clear which one is the winner.

6
00:00:27,073 --> 00:00:29,649
Motivation is the underlying factor.

7
00:00:29,737 --> 00:00:32,681
I believe in everything that we do on a daily basis.

8
00:00:32,793 --> 00:00:38,725
If you don't have motivation in something that you do, then you really can't achieve what it is that you want to achieve.

9
00:00:39,225 --> 00:00:44,673
Everyone has motivation for things that they're passionate about, things that interest you, things that inspire you.

10
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:50,889
And of course, you'll have motivation if you play a sport, if you're in drama, if you're in band, you'll have motivation to accomplish that task.

11
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:56,277
But the true test of finding motivation is if you can find it in something that doesn't interest you.

12
00:00:56,381 --> 00:01:06,145
Personally, I'm interested in sitting through town council meetings and reading the 404 page Town of Barnstable budget, but others might not find so much paper so interesting.

13
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:11,389
However, motivation can be found in everything that you do.

14
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:17,117
I like to look at it in terms of finding motivation as just putting yourself in someone else's shoes.

15
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:20,221
When you're questioning, why do I have to do this?

16
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:21,221
Why do I have to put in the time?

17
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:22,519
Why do I have to put in the effort?

18
00:01:22,637 --> 00:01:31,499
You can just look at what you're doing and say, this helps this person because, or this person is going to appreciate my effort and my motivation on this task because.

19
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:40,731
And I've always found that, that appreciation that others have for the effort that you put in, that's what motivates me, the fact that someone's going to appreciate what I did.

20
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:46,643
So when the teacher gives you a paper or something to do and you say, this is stupid, I have better things to do.

21
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:48,659
I'd much rather go outside and throw a football.

22
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:56,969
Whatever it is, look at it and say, this person is going to appreciate the work this person put in the effort to create the assignment.

23
00:01:57,057 --> 00:01:59,465
Now they're going to see it and they're going to appreciate it.

24
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:04,513
And I do that in every assignment that I'm given and everything that is ever brought before me.

25
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:10,005
And that's always something that I think we need to go out and look at when we go out to tackle an issue.

26
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:16,225
Filing papers, people might not find it interesting, but think about how much help you're doing to somebody else.

27
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:22,765
Think about the responsibility that you're helping someone else fulfill and that sort of help and appreciation motivates you.

28
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:31,881
For me, fine, dressing is something that I like to do every single day and I don't just do it because I enjoy it, I do it because people appreciate it.

29
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:37,577
People see that I took the extra time to prepare myself for whatever it is that I'm doing and they thank me for it.

30
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:38,433
And that thanks.

31
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,753
That appreciation is truly what motivates me to go out and do whatever it is that is put before me.

32
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:53,529
So I want to finish briefly just by saying that motivation is so important in anything that you do and without it you really can't accomplish what you want.

33
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:55,801
But with it you have the passion to affect change.

34
00:02:55,833 --> 00:03:03,745
You have the passion to make a difference and you really do have the passion to go out and change the way things are done and make a difference in anything that you want to do.

35
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:04,985
Thank you for your time and your ears.
