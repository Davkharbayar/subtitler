1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,081
Wow, what an audience.

2
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:17,405
But if I'm being honest, I don't care what you think of my talk.

3
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:18,785
I don't.

4
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:24,217
I care what the Internet thinks of my talk because they're the ones who get it seen and get it shared.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:26,239
And I think that's where most people get it wrong.

6
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:29,971
They're talking to you here instead of talking to you.

7
00:00:30,123 --> 00:00:35,455
Random person scrolling Facebook thanks for the click.

8
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:41,615
You see, back in 2009 we all had these weird little things called attention spans.

9
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:43,179
Yeah, they're gone.

10
00:00:43,227 --> 00:00:43,571
They're gone.

11
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:44,515
We killed them.

12
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:45,615
They're dead.

13
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:49,843
I'm trying to think of the last time I watched an 18 minute TED talk.

14
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:50,995
It's been years.

15
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:52,529
Literally years.

16
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:55,485
So if you're giving a TED Talk, keep it quick.

17
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:57,309
I'm doing mine in under a minute.

18
00:00:57,437 --> 00:00:59,101
I'm at 44 seconds right now.

19
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:01,293
That means we got time for one final joke.

20
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,145
Why are balloons so expensive?

21
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:06,085
Inflation.
